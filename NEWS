Guile-Lib NEWS


guile-lib 0.1.6 -- 2007-09-24
=============================

* New module: (apicheck).

Apicheck implements one function to describe a set of modules' API as an
s-expression, and another to verify the s-expression against the current
API.

* New module: (sxml fold).

(sxml fold) defines a number of fold-based XML transformation operators.

* Improved support for parsing Texinfo.

(texinfo) now parses the arguments of the @deffnx family of commands.
Added support for parsing the inline commands @b, @i, @r, @sansserif,
@slanted, @t, and @tie.

* Better automatic documentation via (texinfo reflection).

Generic functions are now documented along with all of their methods.
Documentation for methods is now taken from their procedure
implementation.

Documentation produced with `module-stexi-documentation' may now be
filtered or elided via a user-supplied procedure. This allows procedures
defined in C to have their documentation supplied from a source that is
not a docstring or an object property, for example from docs snarfed
from the C source, or from docs written in a separate texinfo file.

Procedures documented by `module-stexi-documentation' are now ordered in
the order in which they appear in the module's export list, if it is
possible to obtain this information.

* Limited support for transforming Docbook to Texinfo.

(texinfo docbook) defines procedures for parsing docbook into SXML,
flattening that SXML into a form more like STEXI, and a stylesheet for
transforming a limited subset of that SXML into STEXI. The stylesheet
may be extended by user code in order to support more docbook elements.

* Guile-Lib now has API regression tests.

Using Apicheck, we now know the exact interface exported by Guile-Lib,
so that there will be no unintentional breakages in the future.

* Bugfixes

See the ChangeLog for details on fixes to (sxml ssax input-parse) and
(string wrap).


guile-lib 0.1.5 -- 2007-08-09
=============================

* New module (container async-queue).

(container async-queue) implements a simple thread-safe message queue.

* Fixes for Guile 1.8

READ-LINE is now in (ice-9 rdelim) instead of the core; guile-lib has
been updated accordingly.


guile-lib 0.1.4 -- 2007-07-20
=============================

* First release with NEWS.

* New module (match-bind).

(match-bind) implements a syntax to bind lexical variables to regular
expression match results. (match-bind) also exports two procedures, s///
and s///g, that perform search-and-replace with a perl-like syntax.

* New module (scheme kwargs).

Two new macros are exported, lambda/kwargs and define/kwargs, which
implement keyword and optional function arguments in a manner that is
more intuitive than Guile's standard lambda*.

* Other bugfixes and improvements.

See the ChangeLog for details on changes to (texinfo serialize),
(texinfo html), (texinfo), and (sxml simple).

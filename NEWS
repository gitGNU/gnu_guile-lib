Guile-Lib README


Guile-Lib is intended as an accumulation place for pure-scheme Guile
modules, allowing for people to cooperate integrating their generic
Guile modules into a coherent library. Think "a down-scaled,
limited-scope CPAN for Guile".

guile-lib 0.1.5 -- unreleased
=============================

* New module (container async-queue).

(container async-queue) implements a simple thread-safe message queue.

* Fixes for Guile 1.8

READ-LINE is now in (ice-9 rdelim) instead of the core.


guile-lib 0.1.4 -- 2007-07-20
=============================

* First release with NEWS.

* New module (match-bind).

(match-bind) implements a syntax to bind lexical variables to regular
expression match results. (match-bind) also exports two procedures, s///
and s///g, that perform search-and-replace with a perl-like syntax.

* New module (scheme kwargs).

Two new macros are exported, lambda/kwargs and define/kwargs, which
implement keyword and optional function arguments in a manner that is
more intuitive than Guile's standard lambda*.

* Other bugfixes and improvements.

See the ChangeLog for details on changes to (texinfo serialize),
(texinfo html), (texinfo), and (sxml simple).

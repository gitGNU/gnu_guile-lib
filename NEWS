Guile-Lib NEWS -- history of user-visible changes.

Version 0.1.3

  - Work has been started to extract all documentation directly from
    the source code, see new-doc/=README for details.

  - New modules, written by Andy Wingo <wingo@pobox.com>:
  
    + (texinfo serialize), allows to convert stexi to texi.

  - (unit-test) now doesn't use call/cc anymore. This should provide a
    bit of a speed up and prevent Guile segfaults on at least the ia64
    architecture (see
    http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=291551).

  - (srfi srfi-35) now adds condition field names as init-keywords
    to the classes created by make-condition-type.

  - "make test" now exits with a non-zero exit code upon error.

Version 0.1.2

 - (unit-test) now has assert-exception, which passes only when an
   exception is thrown.

 - A lot of new modules, written or packaged by Andy Wingo

     http://neilvandyke.org/htmlprag/.

   + (texinfo ...), a suite of tools built on SSAX to process Texinfo.
   + (statprof), a statistical profiler for Guile.
   + (container nodal-tree), a tree consisting of nodes with attributes.
   + (container delay-tree), a nodal tree whose fields can be promises

Guile-Lib -- a repository of useful code written in Guile Scheme
================================================================

Guile-Lib is intended as an accumulation place for pure-scheme Guile
modules, allowing for people to cooperate integrating their generic
Guile modules into a coherent library.

Guile-Lib modules are well-documented and well-supported. Particularly
good modules might migrate from Guile-Lib into Guile itself, at some
point.

Think "a down-scaled, limited-scope CPAN for Guile".

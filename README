Guile-Lib -- a repository of useful code written in Guile Scheme
================================================================

Guile-Lib is intended as an accumulation place for pure-scheme Guile
modules, allowing for people to cooperate integrating their generic
Guile modules into a coherent library. Think "a down-scaled,
limited-scope CPAN for Guile".

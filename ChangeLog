	* src/unit-test/guileUnit.scm: Now named just unit-test.scm;
	uppercase is un-schemish ;). All tests adapted.

2003-12-27  Richard Todd  <richardt@vzavenue.net>

	* src/unit-test/guileUnit.scm (assert-numeric-=): new
	  function... compares numbers with a precision value.

	* src/os/process.scm: obscured all symbols exported just because
	macros use them.

2003-12-26  Richard Todd  <richardt@vzavenue.net>

	* src/math/primes.scm (prime?): changed SLIB byte-arrays to guile
	uniform-vectors.
	(prime:prngs): changed from make-random-state to
	               seed->random-state, to avoid pulling in more of
	               SLIB.

2003-12-24  Richard Todd  <richardt@vzavenue.net>>

	* src/unit-test/guileUnit.scm (run): Added messages to screen as
	tests run.
	(add): When a <test-case> is added, all the methods of name
	      matching /^test.*/ are scheduled to run.
	(test-case-suite): Now only internally used, since (add) will
	                   perform this operation for <test-case>'s now.
	(run-all-defined-test-cases): New function...selects all classes
	                              derived from <test-case> to be run,
	                              and runs the tests.  This should
	                              almost always be what the user wants
	                              to do.
	(exit-with-summary): New function...displays summary information
	                     about results.
